3D Game Development using Java's LWJGL

Currently a WIP and will most likely not work as intended if repo is cloned

Lightweight java game library (LWJGL) is a Java library that enables cross-platform access to popular native APIs useful in the development of graphics (OpenGL, Vulkan), audio (OpenAL) and parallel computing (OpenCL) applications. This access is direct and high-performance, yet also wrapped in a type-safe and user-friendly layer, appropriate for the Java ecosystem. LWJGL is open source.
